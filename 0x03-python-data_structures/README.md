Print a list of integers
0-print_list_integer.py: Python program that prints all integers of a list.
Format: one integer per line. See example
You are not allowed to import any module
You can assume that the list only contains integers
You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
You have to use str.format() to print integers
Secure access to an element in a list

1-element_at.py: Python program that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
If idx is negative, the function should return None
If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return None
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use try/except
Replace element

2-replace_in_list.py: Python program that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
If idx is negative, the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use try/except
Print a list of integers... in reverse!

3-print_reversed_list_integer.py: Python program that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
Format: one integer per line. See example
You are not allowed to import any module
You can assume that the list only contains integers
You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
You have to use str.format() to print integers
Replace in a copy

4-new_in_list.py: Python program that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C)
If idx is negative, the function should return a copy of the original list
If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return a copy of the original list
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use try/except
Can you C me now?

5-no_c.py: Python program that removes all characters c and C from a string.
The function should return the new string
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use str.replace()
